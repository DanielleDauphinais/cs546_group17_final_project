# Little Free Library Connections ðŸ“šðŸ“˜
This application is a website that connects users to Little free libraries in Hoboken. Users can create libraries, add comments to a library and rate the fullness of the library so donors know when it needs to be refilled and book readers know when to visit the library.  This application creates a more community feel to the libraries so people can interact with each other. These kinds of libraries are a take a book leave a book so knowing the exact inventory would not be worth keeping track of but know how full and what kind of books are available would be good for donors and visitors
